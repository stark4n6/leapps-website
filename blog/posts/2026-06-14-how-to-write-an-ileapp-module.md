The LEAPPs ecosystem runs on contributions. Every artifact module in iLEAPP, ALEAPP, RLEAPP, and VLEAPP was written by someone who looked at a data source, figured out what it contained, and wrote the code to surface it. That is how the tools grew from a handful of modules to the hundreds that exist today. It is also how they will keep growing.

This post is for anyone who wants to add to that. Whether you are a developer who has never touched a forensics tool or an examiner who writes Python but has never contributed to an open source project, the barrier is lower than you might think. A module is a single Python file. The framework handles all the output — HTML reports, TSV exports, timeline entries, and LAVA database population. Your job is to find the data and return it in a consistent format.

The guide below walks through everything: the module structure, the metadata block that drives the framework, parsing SQLite databases and plists, handling timestamps, wiring LAVA conversation view for messaging artifacts, and submitting a pull request. It includes a complete working example you can use as a starting point.

One note before you dive in. This is a working guide, not a finished specification. The LEAPPs tools and LAVA are under active development, and the contributor workflow will continue to evolve. A dedicated documentation site is in progress that will house always-current documentation for iLEAPP, ALEAPP, RLEAPP, VLEAPP, and LAVA in one place. Until that site is live, this post is the best starting point. It reflects the current state of the codebase accurately, but check the repository for any changes that may have landed after publication.

A downloadable PDF version of this guide is available here: [iLEAPP Module Contributor Guide (PDF)](/downloads/ileapp-module-contributor-guide.pdf)

With that said — pick an artifact, open a file, and write the module. The community benefits every time someone does.

---

> **Note:** This guide uses iLEAPP as its reference, but the module structure, `__artifacts_v2__` format, helper functions, LAVA integration, and PR process are identical across all LEAPPs tools. Everything here applies equally to ALEAPP, RLEAPP, and VLEAPP. The only differences are the target repository and the artifact paths relevant to each platform.

---

## What a Module Is

Every artifact iLEAPP parses comes from a module — a single Python file in `scripts/artifacts/`. iLEAPP loads all modules in that folder automatically at runtime. There is no registry to update and no configuration file to edit. Drop a valid module file in the folder and iLEAPP picks it up.

Each module defines what files to look for, how to parse them, and what data to return. The framework handles all output: HTML report, TSV, timeline, and LAVA database.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10–3.12
- A local clone of the iLEAPP repository: `https://github.com/abrignoni/iLEAPP`
- Dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- A test extraction or sample image to run against

---

## Module Structure

A module has two required parts: the `__artifacts_v2__` dictionary and the processing function.

### 1. `__artifacts_v2__`

This must be the first thing in the file. It tells iLEAPP everything it needs to know about the artifact before parsing begins.

```python
__artifacts_v2__ = {
    "myArtifact": {
        "name": "My Artifact",
        "description": "Extracts data from MyApp",
        "author": "@YourHandle",
        "creation_date": "2025-01-01",
        "last_update_date": "2025-01-01",
        "requirements": "none",
        "category": "Social Media",
        "notes": "",
        "paths": ('*/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/*/Library/myapp.db',),
        "output_types": "standard",
        "artifact_icon": "message-circle"
    }
}
```

**Field reference:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"myArtifact"` (key) | Must exactly match the processing function name |
| `name` | Display name in reports and LAVA |
| `description` | One-line description of what it parses |
| `author` | Your name or handle |
| `creation_date` | Date you wrote it (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `last_update_date` | Date of last change (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `requirements` | Python package requirements, or `"none"` |
| `category` | Category grouping in reports and LAVA |
| `notes` | Research references, caveats, or empty string |
| `paths` | Tuple of file path patterns (wildcards supported) |
| `output_types` | What output formats to generate (see below) |
| `artifact_icon` | Feather icon name for HTML sidebar |

**`output_types` values:**

| Value | Output generated |
|-------|-----------------|
| `"standard"` | HTML, TSV, timeline, and LAVA — use this for most artifacts |
| `"all"` | All of the above plus KML |
| `"lava_only"` | LAVA database only, no HTML report |
| `"none"` | No output (used for modules that only collect device info) |
| List e.g. `["html", "lava"]` | Specific combination |

**`paths` wildcards:**

```python
# Single file
"paths": ('*/mobile/Library/SMS/sms.db',)

# Multiple patterns
"paths": (
    '*/mobile/Library/CallHistoryDB/CallHistory.storedata',
    '*/mobile/Library/CallHistoryDB/call_history.db',
)

# Match all files in a directory
"paths": ('*/mobile/Library/SMS/Attachments/*',)
```

**`artifact_icon` values:**

Use any icon name from the Feather icon set (https://feathericons.com). Common choices: `"message-circle"`, `"phone-call"`, `"user"`, `"map-pin"`, `"clock"`, `"wifi"`, `"camera"`, `"file"`.

---

### 2. The Processing Function

The function name must match the key in `__artifacts_v2__`. It takes a single `context` argument and returns a tuple of `(data_headers, data_list, source_path)`.

```python
from scripts.ilapfuncs import artifact_processor, get_file_path, get_sqlite_db_records

@artifact_processor
def myArtifact(context):
    files_found = context.get_files_found()
    source_path = get_file_path(files_found, "myapp.db")
    data_list = []

    query = '''
    SELECT timestamp, sender, message
    FROM messages
    '''

    records = get_sqlite_db_records(source_path, query)
    for record in records:
        data_list.append((record[0], record[1], record[2]))

    data_headers = (
        ('Timestamp', 'datetime'),
        'Sender',
        'Message'
    )
    return data_headers, data_list, source_path
```

The `@artifact_processor` decorator handles all output generation. Your function only needs to return clean data.

---

## Returning Data

### `data_headers`

A tuple defining column names. Plain strings for text columns. Tuples of `(name, type)` for columns that need special rendering.

```python
data_headers = (
    ('Timestamp', 'datetime'),       # Rendered as human-readable date/time
    ('Modified Date', 'datetime'),
    'Sender',                        # Plain text
    'Message',
    ('Attachment', 'media'),         # Rendered as inline image/video in LAVA
    ('Phone Number', 'phonenumber'), # Formatted phone number
    ('File Size', 'bytes'),          # Rendered as KB/MB/etc.
)
```

**Special column types:**

| Type | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `datetime` | Unix epoch integers or Cocoa timestamps converted to UTC |
| `date` | Date-only values |
| `media` | File paths to images, video, or other media |
| `phonenumber` | Phone number strings |
| `bytes` | Integer byte counts |

### `data_list`

A list of tuples. Each tuple is one row. Values must be in the same order as `data_headers`.

```python
data_list = [
    (1681579809, "Alice", "See you tomorrow", "/path/to/image.jpg", "+19195551234", 204800),
    (1681580100, "Bob",   "Confirmed",        None,                 "+19195559876", 0),
]
```

Null/missing values should be `None`.

### `source_path`

The path to the source file the data came from. Used for report attribution and audit trails. If data came from multiple files, return the primary one or a descriptive string pointing to a source column.

```python
# Single file
return data_headers, data_list, source_path

# Multiple source files — add a source column to each row instead
return data_headers, data_list, "See Source File column"
```

---

## Parsing SQLite Databases

Most iOS artifacts are in SQLite databases. Use `get_sqlite_db_records` from `ilapfuncs`.

```python
from scripts.ilapfuncs import artifact_processor, get_file_path, get_sqlite_db_records

@artifact_processor
def myArtifact(context):
    files_found = context.get_files_found()
    source_path = get_file_path(files_found, "myapp.db")
    data_list = []

    query = '''
    SELECT
        ZMESSAGE_DATE,
        ZSENDER,
        ZBODY
    FROM ZMESSAGE
    ORDER BY ZMESSAGE_DATE
    '''

    records = get_sqlite_db_records(source_path, query)
    for record in records:
        data_list.append((record[0], record[1], record[2]))

    data_headers = (
        ('Timestamp', 'datetime'),
        'Sender',
        'Message'
    )
    return data_headers, data_list, source_path
```

---

## Parsing Plist Files

For plist-based artifacts, use `get_plist_file_content`.

```python
from scripts.ilapfuncs import artifact_processor, get_file_path, get_plist_file_content, convert_plist_date_to_utc

@artifact_processor
def myArtifact(context):
    files_found = context.get_files_found()
    source_path = get_file_path(files_found, "com.example.myapp.plist")
    data_list = []

    pl = get_plist_file_content(source_path)
    if not pl or not isinstance(pl, dict):
        return (), [], ''

    for entry in pl.get('entries', []):
        timestamp = convert_plist_date_to_utc(entry.get('date', ''))
        value = entry.get('value', '')
        data_list.append((timestamp, value))

    data_headers = (
        ('Date', 'datetime'),
        'Value'
    )
    return data_headers, data_list, source_path
```

---

## Timestamp Conversion

Always store timestamps as UTC. Use the appropriate conversion helper.

```python
from scripts.ilapfuncs import (
    convert_cocoa_core_data_ts_to_utc,  # Cocoa/Core Data epoch (seconds since 2001-01-01)
    convert_unix_ts_to_utc,             # Unix epoch in seconds
    convert_plist_date_to_utc,          # Plist datetime objects
    convert_ts_human_to_utc,            # Human-readable timestamp strings
)
```

---

## Adding LAVA Conversation View

If your artifact contains messages, add `data_views` to the `__artifacts_v2__` definition to enable conversation view in LAVA.

```python
__artifacts_v2__ = {
    "myMessaging": {
        "name": "My Messaging App",
        "description": "Extracts messages from MyApp",
        "author": "@YourHandle",
        "creation_date": "2025-01-01",
        "last_update_date": "2025-01-01",
        "requirements": "none",
        "category": "Messaging",
        "notes": "",
        "paths": ('*/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/*/Library/myapp.db',),
        "output_types": "standard",
        "artifact_icon": "message-circle",
        "data_views": {
            "conversation": {
                "conversationDiscriminatorColumn": "Thread ID",
                "conversationLabelColumn": "Contact Name",
                "textColumn": "Message",
                "directionColumn": "Direction",
                "directionSentValue": "Sent",
                "timeColumn": "Timestamp",
                "senderColumn": "Sender",
                "mediaColumn": "Attachment"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The column names in `data_views` must match the display names defined in `data_headers` — not the raw SQL column names.

**Conversation view fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `conversationDiscriminatorColumn` | yes | Column that groups messages into threads |
| `conversationLabelColumn` | no | Column used to label threads in the sidebar |
| `textColumn` | yes | Column containing message text |
| `directionColumn` | yes | Column indicating sent vs received |
| `directionSentValue` | yes | Value in `directionColumn` that means sent (string or integer) |
| `timeColumn` | yes | Column containing message timestamp |
| `senderColumn` | no | Column containing sender identity for received messages |
| `sentMessageLabelColumn` | no | Column to use as sender label for sent messages |
| `sentMessageStaticLabel` | no | Fixed string label for sent messages (e.g. `"This Phone"`) |
| `mediaColumn` | no | Column containing media attachment reference |

## Complete Module Example

A full working module for a hypothetical SQLite-based messaging artifact.

```python
__artifacts_v2__ = {
    "exampleMessages": {
        "name": "Example App - Messages",
        "description": "Extracts messages from Example App",
        "author": "@YourHandle",

        "artifact_icon": "message-circle",
        "data_views": {
            "conversation": {
                "conversationDiscriminatorColumn": "Thread ID",
                "conversationLabelColumn": "Contact",
                "textColumn": "Message",
                "directionColumn": "Direction",
                "directionSentValue": "Sent",
                "timeColumn": "Timestamp",
                "senderColumn": "Contact",
                "mediaColumn": "Attachment"
            }
        }
    }
}

from scripts.ilapfuncs import (
    artifact_processor,
    get_file_path,
    get_sqlite_db_records,
    convert_unix_ts_to_utc
)

@artifact_processor
def exampleMessages(context):
    files_found = context.get_files_found()
    source_path = get_file_path(files_found, "example.db")
    data_list = []

    query = '''
    SELECT
        m.timestamp,
        m.thread_id,
        c.display_name,
        CASE m.direction WHEN 1 THEN 'Sent' ELSE 'Received' END,
        m.body,
        m.attachment_path
    FROM messages m
    LEFT JOIN contacts c ON m.contact_id = c.id
    ORDER BY m.timestamp
    '''

    records = get_sqlite_db_records(source_path, query)
    for record in records:
        timestamp = convert_unix_ts_to_utc(record[0])
        data_list.append((
            timestamp,
            record[1],  # thread_id
            record[2],  # contact name
            record[3],  # direction
            record[4],  # message body
            record[5],  # attachment path
        ))

    data_headers = (
        ('Timestamp', 'datetime'),
        'Thread ID',
        'Contact',
        'Direction',
        'Message',
        ('Attachment', 'media'),
    )
    return data_headers, data_list, source_path
```

## Testing Your Module

Run iLEAPP against a test extraction and verify your artifact appears in the output.

**CLI:**
```bash
python ileapp.py -t fs -i /path/to/extraction -o /path/to/output
```

**GUI:**
```bash
python ileappGUI.py
```

Check the output folder for:

- An HTML report file for your artifact
- A TSV file with the same data
- The `_lava_artifacts.db` containing your artifact's table
- The `_lava_data.lava` containing your artifact's definition

Verify the LAVA output by opening the project in LAVA and confirming your artifact appears in the correct category with the correct columns.
