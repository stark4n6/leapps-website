excerpt: Batch LEAPP runs any LEAPP tool across an entire folder of extractions and builds one report index that links every result, with hashing and a manifest for your case file. Here is what it does and how to get it.

# Introducing Batch LEAPP

If you have ever had a folder full of extractions and needed to run them through iLEAPP one at a time, this is for you. Batch LEAPP takes a directory, finds every extraction inside it, and runs the LEAPP tool of your choice against each one. You walk away and come back to a set of finished reports ready for review.

It works with iLEAPP, ALEAPP, RLEAPP, and VLEAPP. They share the same command line, so the same tool drives any of them.

## What it does

- Recursively finds every extraction archive (zip, tar, tar.gz) and runs the LEAPP tool on each into its own output folder.
- Computes the SHA-256 of each input and writes a manifest (CSV and JSON) for your case file.
- Runs several extractions in parallel, with a live progress log.
- Skips things that are not extractions, like prior report folders and stray cache files, so you do not get garbage runs.
- Flags corrupt or mislabeled archives instead of crashing on them.
- Lets you preview the whole plan with a dry run before committing hours of processing.

## One index for everything

When the batch finishes you get a single index.html at the root of the output folder. One row per extraction, with links to the report, the LAVA project, and the input hash. It is styled to match the LEAPPs reports, and every link is relative so you can zip the whole output folder and hand it off.

## Straight into LAVA

If LAVA is installed, the LAVA button opens a dialog with the exact path to the project so you can load it in a couple of clicks. If LAVA is not installed, the button points you to where to get it.

## Built for casework

Hashing is on by default. The manifest records what was processed, each input SHA-256, the status, and where each report and LAVA file landed. Stop means stop: closing the app or clicking Stop terminates the running LEAPP processes instead of leaving them going in the background.

## Get it

Batch LEAPP is free and open source. There is a graphical app and a command line version, with prebuilt downloads for macOS and Windows so you do not need Python installed.

- Download: [github.com/abrignoni/batch-leapp/releases/latest](https://github.com/abrignoni/batch-leapp/releases/latest)
- Source and docs: [github.com/abrignoni/batch-leapp](https://github.com/abrignoni/batch-leapp)

Point it at the LEAPP command line tool (for example ileapp.py or the CLI binary), not the interactive GUI build. Feedback and pull requests are welcome.
